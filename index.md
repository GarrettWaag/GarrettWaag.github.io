### Self Assessment
  Throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University, I have expanded my programming knowledge, learned how to manage databases and focus on security issues. I now have a good understanding of both SQL and MongoDB. When I started this program, I only was proficient in a few languages like C# and JavaScript. After a few of the courses focusing on other languages I can also program in C++, Java, Python and more. I have also expanded my knowledge in statistics with data mining. While I did not do any team projects at SNHU my time in my previous program B.A in game design gave me plenty of experience collaborating with teams. 
	The following artifact is a Mongo database for animal shelters. It has a dashboard for users to find good candidates for rescue animals. It uses the Austin Animal Center sample data. The user dashboard has a table with selectable animals and a few sample rescues filters. When selected the filters change a pie chart as well as a geolocation chart when an animal is selected. It shows the animals name and breed in the map. The Admin dashboard adds the capability to create new animal data in the database as well as updating and deleting existing. The python script handles the actual communication between the dashboard and the database.
